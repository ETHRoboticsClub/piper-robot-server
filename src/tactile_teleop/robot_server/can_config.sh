#!/bin/bash

# Usage Instructions:

# 1. Prerequisites
#     The ip and ethtool tools need to be installed on the system.
#     sudo apt install ethtool can-utils
#     Ensure the gs_usb driver is properly installed.

# 2. Background
#  This script is designed to automatically manage, rename, and activate CAN (Controller Area Network) interfaces.
#  It checks the current number of CAN modules in the system and renames and activates CAN interfaces based on predefined USB ports.
#  This is very useful for systems with multiple CAN modules, especially when different CAN modules need specific names.

# 3. Main Functions
#  Check CAN module count: Ensure the number of CAN modules detected in the system matches the preset count.
#  Get USB port information: Use ethtool to get USB port information for each CAN module.
#  Validate USB ports: Check if the USB port of each CAN module matches the predefined port list.
#  Rename CAN interfaces: Rename CAN interfaces to target names based on predefined USB ports.

# 4. Script Configuration Instructions
#   Key configuration items in the script include expected CAN module count, default CAN interface names, and bitrate settings:
#   1. Expected CAN module count:
#     EXPECTED_CAN_COUNT=1
#     This value determines the number of CAN modules that should be detected in the system.
#   2. Default CAN interface name for single CAN module:
#     DEFAULT_CAN_NAME="${1:-can0}"
#     You can specify the default CAN interface name via command line parameters. If no parameter is provided, defaults to can0.
#   3. Default bitrate for single CAN module:
#     DEFAULT_BITRATE="${2:-500000}"
#     You can specify the bitrate for single CAN module via command line parameters. If no parameter is provided, defaults to 500000.
#   4. Configuration for multiple CAN modules:
#     declare -A USB_PORTS
#     USB_PORTS["1-2:1.0"]="can_device_1:500000"
#     USB_PORTS["1-3:1.0"]="can_device_2:250000"
#     The keys here represent USB ports, values are interface names and bitrates separated by colons.

# 5. Usage Steps
#  1. Edit the script:
#   1. Modify predefined values:
#      - Predefined CAN module count: EXPECTED_CAN_COUNT=2, can be modified to match the number of CAN modules inserted on the industrial PC
#      - If there's only one CAN module, after setting the above parameters, you can skip this section and continue
#      - (Multiple CAN modules) Predefined USB ports and target interface names:
#          First insert a CAN module into the expected USB port. Note that during initial configuration, insert one CAN module at a time on the industrial PC
#          Then execute sudo ethtool -i can0 | grep bus, and record the parameters after bus-info:
#          Next, insert the next CAN module. Note it cannot be in the same USB port as the previous CAN module, then repeat the previous step
#          (Actually, you can use one CAN module to plug into different USB ports, because modules are distinguished by USB address)
#          After all modules have been designed for their respective USB ports and recorded,
#          Modify the USB ports (bus-info) and target interface names according to actual conditions.
#          can_device_1:500000, the former is the set CAN name, the latter is the set bitrate
#            declare -A USB_PORTS
#            USB_PORTS["1-2:1.0"]="can_device_1:500000"
#            USB_PORTS["1-3:1.0"]="can_device_2:250000"
#          What needs to be modified is the content within the double quotes of USB_PORTS["1-3:1.0"], change it to the parameters recorded after bus-info: above
#   2. Grant script execution permissions:
#       Open terminal, navigate to the script directory, execute the following command to grant script execution permissions:
#       chmod +x can_config.sh
#   3. Run the script:
#     Use sudo to execute the script, as the script requires administrator privileges to modify network interfaces:
#       1. Single CAN module
#         1. You can specify the default CAN interface name and bitrate via command line parameters (defaults to can0 and 500000):
#           sudo bash ./can_config.sh [CAN_interface_name] [bitrate]
#           For example, to specify interface name as my_can_interface and bitrate as 1000000:
#           sudo bash ./can_config.sh my_can_interface 1000000
#         2. You can specify CAN name through specified USB hardware address
#           sudo bash ./can_config.sh [CAN_interface_name] [bitrate] [USB_hardware_address]
#           For example, to specify interface name as my_can_interface, bitrate as 1000000, USB hardware address as 1-3:1.0:
#           sudo bash ./can_config.sh my_can_interface 1000000 1-3:1.0
#           This assigns the CAN device at USB address 1-3:1.0 the name my_can_interface with bitrate 1000000
#       2. Multiple CAN modules
#         For multiple CAN modules, specify the interface name and bitrate for each CAN module by setting the USB_PORTS array in the script.
#         No additional parameters needed, run the script directly:
#         sudo ./can_config.sh

# Important Notes

#     Permission Requirements:
#         The script requires sudo privileges because renaming and configuring network interfaces requires administrator permissions.
#         Ensure you have sufficient permissions to run this script.

#     Script Environment:
#         This script assumes it runs in a bash environment. Ensure your system uses bash, not other shells (like sh).
#         You can ensure bash is used by checking the script's Shebang line (#!/bin/bash).

#     USB Port Information:
#         Ensure your predefined USB port information (bus-info) matches the actual ethtool output information in the system.
#         Use commands like sudo ethtool -i can0, sudo ethtool -i can1 etc. to check the bus-info of each CAN interface.

#     Interface Conflicts:
#         Ensure target interface names (like can_device_1, can_device_2) are unique and don't conflict with other existing interface names in the system.
#         If you want to modify the correspondence between USB ports and interface names, adjust the USB_PORTS array according to actual conditions.
